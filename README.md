# Efficient Probabilistic Performance Bounds for Inverse Reinforcement Learning
### Follow the instructions below to reproduce results used in AAAI 2018 paper.
  - Make a build directory: `mkdir build`
  - Then use `make` to build `birl_test`
  - Execute `./birl_test` to run
  - Edit `src/birl_test.cpp` to use different gridworld size
